## 2023 MDDN342 Assignment 2: Randomised Collections

Made a face! I guess I should make another one now!  I am not sure what colors to go with yet seeing as how my sketches were black and white.  I am curious to know how to make the faces more energetic.  As that has been my main focus so far.  Maybe I try a different type of face completely opposite of energetic.
